5. Reflect on Dependencies: 
    Think about all the services and tools youâ€™d rely on during your Swiss journey, from travel agencies to GPS apps. How do these dependencies relate to the Dependency Inversion Principle in software design? 

Ans:-
    **Dependency Inversion Principle**:
        The Dependency Inversion Principle in software design is like planning a trip where you focus on what you need rather than which specific service or tool provides it. By focusing on your needs instead of specific details, you can easily adapt to different services or tools without changing your entire travel plan. It's about staying flexible and not being tied to one particular choice.
